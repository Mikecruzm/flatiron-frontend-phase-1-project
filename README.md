My Flatiron Frontend Phase 1 Project.



## a Meme finder it will find you a random meme with a click of a button!

This project is small project made for my school Flatiron School. In order to demostrate the skills and tools I have learn so far in school. Some of the things I used to get this running was HTML, Main.js and css. 



* create your very own meme finder
* Create a running server to find a meme at random.
* Automatically fetch a meme by a click of a buttom at the top, the memes will come at random, in others words, as a surprise.

1. Clone this project into your terminal
2. Set up 
3. Install live server `ritwickdey.LiveServer`
4. NPM install 


## Make yoor own version 

It's been made and recreated multiple times but to undertsand how it works and to be able to make your own version of it, is the beauty of becoming part of the coding world.
